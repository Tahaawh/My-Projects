# My Projects

A compact collection of front-end and Python projects, exercises, and small demos organized into folders.

Top-level folders
- `HTML CSS-01` — HTML and CSS examples and UI snippets
- `Python-01`, `Python-02` — Python exercises, utilities, and sample scripts
- `Python-Mid01`, `Python-Mid2` — mid-term project folders

Usage
- Open `.html` files in a web browser to view demos
- Run Python scripts with Python 3: `python script.py`

If a folder lacks details, open its `README.md` and add short notes about purpose and how to run examples.
